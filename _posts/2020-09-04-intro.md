Hi there!

I'm putting together this site to compile little posts and thoughts as they come to mind,
alongside my bigger projects. I'm a big believer in the [Feynman Technique](https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/),
and that you can't truly know something until you explain it. I also know that "data science"
just isn't what it is ["made out to be"](https://veekaybee.github.io/2019/02/13/data-science-is-different/),
and my "linear regression tutorial" isn't going to light the world on fire.

But there are still things I like putting together, and plan on posting here. Some basic tutorials,
something I just can't get off my mind. We'll see where it goes!

Here goes nothing!:rocket:
