I'm Andrew Hunt, a current data analyst and aspiring data scientist.

I've spent the last two years at McLagan, an HR consulting firm specializing in the financial services industry.
I analyze trends in compensation and productivity data, and help firms benchmark their employees relative to the market.

I graduated from Fordham University in 2018, where I studied Economics and minored in Computer Science. (Go Rams!)
